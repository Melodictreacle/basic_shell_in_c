A minimalist Unix-like shell written in C. It provides a simple command-line interface that reads user input, tokenizes commands, and executes them using system calls like fork() and execvp(). The shell supports basic command execution and includes an exit command to terminate the session.

This project demonstrates core concepts of Unix process management, input parsing, and command execution in C.
